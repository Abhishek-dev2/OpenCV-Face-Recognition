1. Create Program which create Dataset
  -Using Viola-Jones Algorithm with either HaarCascade or LBP CascadeClassifier
  -Taking the input and converting it into GrayScale
  -Detecting the faces, croping them and saving it into a folder
2. Create Trainer and trained set
  -Using createLBPHFaceRecognizer() to train the faces detected
  -Using Image.open(imagePath).convert('L') to convert colored and GrayScale
  images into bilevel images using Floyd-Steinberg dither
    --dither – Dithering method, used when converting from mode “RGB” to “P” or
    from “RGB” or “L” to “1”. Available methods are NONE or FLOYDSTEINBERG (default)

3. Create Program to recognize
